BattleManager class - initialized with 2 teams.

BattleManager, during initialization, will tell any HumanControlled Team to start building their menu manager



1. create delegate
public delegate returnType delegateName(args) <-- typically called ____Handler

2. Create method that matches delegate signature
public returnType Foo(args)
public returnType Bar(args)

3. Assign at creation:
delegateName baz = new delegateName(Foo);
baz += Bar

4. Invoke the same way you would a method:
baz(args);


EVENTS
1. define event
public event delegateName eventName <-- if the delegate is ____Handler, the event is usually _____

2. Typically we create a method called OnEventName, to which we pass the values to be sent down the pipe.
if(eventName != null)
{
    eventName(args);
}

EVENT ARGS
-wrap all the data you're going to send down the pipeline in one object

public class EventNameEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    eventData { get; set; }
}

if we define custom event args, delegate should be:

returnType delegateName(object sender, CustomEventArgs e);

can now change the declaration of our event slightly:

public event EventHandler<CustomArgs> eventName <-- no longer need to define the delegate explicitly

DecisionManager needs to be able to unset the selected subRegion, and this method would be called when the Region was beaten.
At the same time, the MapGroupingItems should be unlocked for that same subRegion

So you have a list of cutscene components,
most of them are going to be printing.
Cutscene components are a list of items inside the Cutscene
The cutscene belongs to the SubRegion
SubRegion.ExecuteCutscene is called by RegionManager
Cutscene is created in RegionFactory

Shades:

new enemy type. They appear in groups, and always appear with a "bell"
- ringing the bell should banish shades
- different types of bells, different responses, maybe?
    - (copper?) One should require a "blood" sacrifice. That is, lowers users HP to activate its effect
    - (steel?) One could simply weaken the shades, lowering their defense or some such
    - (silver) Another kind would require a prayer and would

-When one shade is killed by conventional means, it is absorbed by one of the others
-(future idea) A player with strong Mercy alignment would be able to use some spell to defeat them, maybe "purify" them
-(future idea) A player with strong Malevolent alignment would be able to use some spell to interact with them (& grow stronger)
