Need to be able to go from one Region to the next (Fields to Casino, Fields to Crystal Caverns, Fields to Desert)
Need to be able to go from one SubRegion to the next (Desert Intro to Wastelands, oasis, town- as an example)
    need to be able to group SubRegions (Wastelands, Oasis, Town in previous example)

Need to be able to "unlock" secret SubRegions/Regions (can't access Dark Cave until Casino, Crystal Caverns, and Desert have been defeated)

Need to be able to pick which region to go to next.
Need to be smart enough to send them to a region if there is no choice

If I did "to from", could create a static list of paths. Any path with a null "from" would be a start node, any path with a null "to" would be an end node

Decision manager can store which region they're going to inside for when they answer 2 questionarres that will later open or bar a particular path.
